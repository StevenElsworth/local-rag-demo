Stepping through the heavy double oak doors, the entrance hall immediately sets a tone of timeless grandeur. A black-and-white marble chequered floor stretches beneath your feet, polished to a soft sheen that reflects the light from a spectacular Murano glass chandelier suspended from a 14-foot ceiling. The walls are finished in a hand-tinted limestone paint, matched with crisp white plaster cornices and mouldings that elegantly frame the upper edge of the room. To the left and right, mahogany console tables with gold leaf detailing sit beneath antique Georgian mirrors with foxed glass, reflecting the stately staircase that rises ahead.
