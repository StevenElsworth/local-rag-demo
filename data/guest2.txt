In a quieter corner of the house, this bedroom embraces a naturalistic theme. The walls are painted in Farrow & Ball’s “Bone,” a warm neutral, with botanical illustrations framed in black wood above the bed. The iron bedstead is dressed in fresh white cotton with moss green throws and linen pillows. The timber floors are slightly lighter here, and a jute rug adds texture underfoot.

A small reading nook by the window includes a tufted armchair in olive velvet and a side table with a ceramic lamp. The wardrobe is a simple shaker-style in off-white, providing a clean and subtle storage solution. Renovation for this understated, calming room would be around £35,000.
