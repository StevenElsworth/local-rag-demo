The master suite occupies the south-facing wing of the first floor and feels more like a private apartment than just a bedroom. The walls are covered in pale blue silk wallpaper with a subtle floral damask, catching the morning light in a soft shimmer. White-painted cornices, restored to their original Georgian detail, crown the room, while the floor beneath is polished oak partially covered by a faded Aubusson rug in rose and cream. Dominating the space is a hand-carved oak four-poster bed with ivory drapes and a deep mattress dressed in Egyptian cotton and embroidered linens.

Near the tall sash windows, a chaise longue upholstered in soft dove-grey velvet invites you to sit and enjoy the countryside views. Twin nightstands flank the bed, each with crystal lamps casting a warm golden glow. A walk-in dressing room opens from one side of the suite, with bespoke wardrobes painted in a muted mushroom tone and fitted with brass fittings. Beyond lies the ensuite bathroom—entirely clad in Italian marble, from the herringbone heated floor to the panelled walls. A freestanding clawfoot tub sits beneath a dormer window, and a spacious walk-in rainfall shower is flanked by twin vanities with antiqued mirror panels. To renovate this suite, considering the high-end finishes and bespoke joinery, the cost would be around £130,000.
