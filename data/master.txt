The master suite occupies the south-facing wing of the first floor and feels more like a private apartment than just a bedroom. Th Dominating the space is a hand-carved oak four-poster bed with ivory drapes and a deep mattress dressed in Egyptian cotton and embroidered linens. This large room is about 55m^2.

Beyond lies the ensuite bathroomâ€”entirely clad in Italian marble, from the herringbone heated floor to the panelled walls. A freestanding clawfoot tub sits beneath a dormer window, and a spacious walk-in rainfall shower is flanked by twin vanities with antiqued mirror panels.
