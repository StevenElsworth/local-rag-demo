The attic has been converted with great care, and the cinema room is perhaps the most contemporary of all the mansion’s spaces. Walls and ceiling are covered in soft acoustic panels upholstered in dark velvet, absorbing sound and creating a cocoon-like atmosphere. A large projection screen is framed by bespoke cabinetry that houses surround-sound equipment and a hidden bar area with LED backlighting.

Reclining cinema chairs in oxblood leather are arranged in three staggered rows, each with integrated cup holders. Carpeting is thick and sound-dampening, and black-out blinds ensure perfect darkness at any time of day. Discreet uplighting along the walls gives the space a boutique-theatre feel. This luxurious media room, with its soundproofing, wiring, and AV systems, would require an estimated £70,000 investment.
