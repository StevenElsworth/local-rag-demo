The attic has been converted with great care, and the cinema room is perhaps the most contemporary of all the mansionâ€™s spaces. The floorspace is large, a total of 200m^2. Walls and ceiling are covered in soft acoustic panels upholstered in dark velvet, absorbing sound and creating a cocoon-like atmosphere. A large projection screen is framed by bespoke cabinetry that houses surround-sound equipment and a hidden bar area with LED backlighting.
