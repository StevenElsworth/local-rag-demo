The library, tucked into a quieter corner of the house. Walls are clad in rich mahogany panelling from floor to ceiling, with built-in bookcases filled with rare editions and well-thumbed classics.

At the centre of the room sits an Edwardian writing desk, its surface scattered with inkpots, a brass reading lamp, and correspondence. This room is relatively small in comaprison at only 30m^2.
