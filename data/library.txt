The library, tucked into a quieter corner of the house, exudes an atmosphere of scholarship and solitude. Walls are clad in rich mahogany panelling from floor to ceiling, with built-in bookcases filled with rare editions and well-thumbed classics. The ceiling is coffered and painted in a muted ochre tone, which softens the effect of the dark wood. A large sash window is dressed in burgundy velvet curtains, lending the room a subtle theatricality.

At the centre of the room sits an Edwardian writing desk, its surface scattered with inkpots, a brass reading lamp, and correspondence. Two deep leather wingback chairs sit nearby, facing a fire burning gently in a stone hearth. An oriental rug in deep reds and navy covers the floorboards, adding warmth and texture to the space. The library’s renovation, including bespoke cabinetry, lighting, and restoration of the antique wood finishes, would cost around £55,000.
