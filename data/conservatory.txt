Flooded with light and filled with life, the garden room is a serene sanctuary. Walls of glass extend from waist height to ceiling, framed in powder-coated iron, while pale limestone tiles line the heated floor. Lush green plants—ferns, citrus trees, and climbing vines—flourish here, placed in terracotta and stone pots. It is a modest size, a total of 40m^2.
