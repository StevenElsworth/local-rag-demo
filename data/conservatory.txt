Flooded with light and filled with life, the garden room is a serene sanctuary. Walls of glass extend from waist height to ceiling, framed in powder-coated iron, while pale limestone tiles line the heated floor. Lush green plants—ferns, citrus trees, and climbing vines—flourish here, placed in terracotta and stone pots.

Furniture is casual yet elegant: rattan chairs with ivory linen cushions, a white-painted iron café table set with garden-themed crockery, and a vintage wrought-iron chandelier overhead. Soft pastel colours—mint, peach, and rose—feature in scattered cushions and throws, echoing the view outside. Renovating and structurally reinforcing this room, with custom heating and glazing, would cost around £45,000.
