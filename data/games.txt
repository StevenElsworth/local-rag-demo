The games room presents a contrastâ€”warm, informal, and nostalgic.The centrepiece is a full-size billiards table with green felt and carved mahogany legs, beneath which hangs a traditional glass-shaded light fitting.

Around the edges of the room are various amusements: a restored pinball machine, a dartboard set into a leather panel, and a bespoke mahogany bar complete with stools upholstered in oxblood leather. Framed vintage pub signs and old sporting prints decorate the walls. The total space is about 80m^2.
