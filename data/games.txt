Next door, the games room presents a contrast—warm, informal, and nostalgic. It features restored exposed beams, a polished oak floor, and vintage-style wallpaper in a burgundy and navy print. The centrepiece is a full-size billiards table with green felt and carved mahogany legs, beneath which hangs a traditional glass-shaded light fitting.

Around the edges of the room are various amusements: a restored pinball machine, a dartboard set into a leather panel, and a bespoke mahogany bar complete with stools upholstered in oxblood leather. Framed vintage pub signs and old sporting prints decorate the walls. Renovating this space, factoring in cabinetry, flooring, furnishings, and lighting, would cost around £50,000.
