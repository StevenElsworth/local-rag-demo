Across the hallway, the dining room reveals itself as a space of regal formality. The walls have been painted in a rich Georgian blue, a pigment that feels both moody and majestic, and are trimmed with delicate lines of gold leaf around the ceiling cornices. A herringbone-patterned oak floor gives the room a stately footing, while a grand 16-seater mahogany dining table dominates the centre. Each chair is a Chippendale reproduction with carved legs and plush damask seat pads in a soft cream tone.

On the far end, a fireplace carved from stone serves as a quiet anchor, with an overmantel mirror reflecting candlelight from the immense crystal chandelier that glitters overhead. Flanking either side are two tall glass-fronted cabinets that house silverware and antique porcelain sets. Warm pools of light fall from wall sconces with silk shades, giving the room a gentle glow during evening meals. Renovating this room to preserve its historical elegance, while upgrading with discreet underfloor heating and hidden AV wiring, would cost in the region of Â£75,000.
