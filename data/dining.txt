The dining room reveals itself as a space of regal formality. The walls have been painted in a rich Georgian blue. A herringbone-patterned oak floor gives the room a stately footing, while a grand 16-seater mahogany dining table dominates the centre. Each chair is a Chippendale reproduction with carved legs and plush damask seat pads in a soft cream tone.

On the far end, a fireplace carved from stone serves as a quiet anchor, with an overmantel mirror reflecting candlelight from the immense crystal chandelier that glitters overhead.
