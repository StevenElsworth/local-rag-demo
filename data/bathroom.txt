Shared by the guest bedrooms, the family bathroom draws on Victorian influences for its design. The walls are tiled halfway up, topped by a dado rail, while the upper wall is painted in blue. The floor (approximately 30m^2) features black-and-white mosaic tiles with underfloor heating beneath.

A freestanding roll-top bath sits beneath a large window, surrounded by potted plants and a wooden bath caddy. A marble-topped vanity unit and chrome fittings add a luxurious touch, while antique bronze wall sconces provide soft lighting.
