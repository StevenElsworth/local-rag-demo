Shared by the guest bedrooms, the family bathroom draws on Victorian influences for its design. The walls are tiled halfway up with glossy white metro tiles, topped by a dado rail, while the upper wall is painted in “Railings” — a deep charcoal blue. The floor features black-and-white mosaic tiles with underfloor heating beneath.

A freestanding roll-top bath sits beneath a large window, surrounded by potted plants and a wooden bath caddy. A marble-topped vanity unit and chrome fittings add a luxurious touch, while antique bronze wall sconces provide soft lighting. The cost to renovate this bathroom, including all tiling, plumbing, and fittings, would come to approximately £30,000.
