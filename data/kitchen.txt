The heart of the home, the kitchen strikes a perfect balance between country charm and high-end functionality. Brass handles and hinges complement the cabinetry, while the stone countertops are a cool grey granite, veined with white. The flooring is traditional flagstone, laid with underfloor heating, and weathered just enough to feel lived in.

A central island made of solid oak offers seating with four high-backed bar stools, ideal for casual breakfast gatherings. Against the back wall stands a gleaming cream-coloured Aga cooker, flanked by open shelving stacked with earthenware bowls, copper pans, and preserved herbs. A long farmhouse table sits near the window, surrounded by Windsor chairs painted in muted greys and blues.
