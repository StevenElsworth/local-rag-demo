The heart of the home, the kitchen strikes a perfect balance between country charm and high-end functionality. Exposed oak ceiling beams stretch above a room painted in soft sage green, echoed by the hand-built cabinetry that runs along every wall. Brass handles and hinges complement the cabinetry, while the stone countertops are a cool grey granite, veined with white. The flooring is traditional flagstone, laid with underfloor heating, and weathered just enough to feel lived in.

A central island made of solid oak offers seating with four high-backed bar stools, ideal for casual breakfast gatherings. Against the back wall stands a gleaming cream-coloured Aga cooker, flanked by open shelving stacked with earthenware bowls, copper pans, and preserved herbs. A long farmhouse table sits near the window, surrounded by Windsor chairs painted in muted greys and blues. Overhead, pendant lights with hand-blown glass shades cast a warm glow. Renovating this kitchen with bespoke joinery, professional-grade appliances, and traditional finishes would command approximately Â£150,000.
