The drawing room lies to the right of the hall, through double doors with bevelled glass insets. Once inside, you're embraced by a room bathed in soft, filtered light from generous bay windows that overlook the formal gardens. The walls are dressed in pastel blue damask wallpaper bordered with ivory moulding, offering a delicate backdrop for a pair of matching velvet Chesterfield sofas in a smoky plum hue. Between them sits a large walnut coffee table, scuffed just enough to suggest age and character, and atop it rests a bowl of fresh-cut peonies.

Underfoot, wide oak floorboards—rich in tone and restored to a satin finish—are partially covered by a vast Persian rug in deep reds and navy. A marble fireplace dominates one wall, flanked by two tall bookcases filled with leather-bound volumes and framed botanical prints. Above the mantle, a gilt-framed oil portrait of a long-forgotten ancestor gazes down with noble detachment. Floor-length silk curtains in soft silver blue are tied back with tasselled cords, framing the view while subtly shimmering in the afternoon light. Renovation for this room, considering upholstery, antique lighting, and conservation of the original fireplace and woodwork, would sit around £80,000.
