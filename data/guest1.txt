This generous guest bedroom features a soft palette of cream, dusty rose, and antique gold. The walls are lined with floral wallpaper inspired by William Morris designs, creating a cosy but elegant atmosphere. Exposed ceiling beams, painted in a light putty tone, give the space a sense of heritage. The brass bed frame is dressed with layered quilts and lace-edged pillowcases, and at the foot sits an upholstered bench with turned wooden legs.

A tall armoire in painted pine stands to one side, and a writing desk beneath the window looks out onto the orchard. Heavy linen curtains in soft blush are tied back with rope tassels. A pair of oil paintings, framed in gilt, lend historical charm. This room, needing only moderate renovation—plasterwork, decoration, furnishing, and new flooring—would cost around £40,000.
