This generous guest bedroom features a soft palette of cream, dusty rose, and antique gold. The brass bed frame is dressed with layered quilts and lace-edged pillowcases, and at the foot sits an upholstered bench with turned wooden legs.

A tall armoire in painted pine stands to one side, and a writing desk beneath the window looks out onto the orchard. Heavy linen curtains in soft blush are tied back with rope tassels.
