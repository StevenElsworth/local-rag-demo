Surrounding the mansion are ten acres of carefully planned gardens and naturalistic landscaping. 

To the side of the estate lies the walled kitchen gardenâ€”a productive space with red brick walls, espaliered apple trees, and raised beds full of vegetables and herbs. A Victorian-style greenhouse in iron and glass houses citrus plants and seedlings. This area also contains a tool shed and potting table, bordered by lavender hedges alive with bees.

Beyond that, a three-acre woodland walk winds beneath ancient oaks and beeches. The garden also contains a full-sized tennis court, stables and two garages.
