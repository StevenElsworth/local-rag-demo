Surrounding the mansion are ten acres of carefully planned gardens and naturalistic landscaping. Directly behind the house, a formal garden is laid out in a symmetrical pattern with low box hedging, gravel paths, and a central limestone fountain. Rose arches bloom in pastel tones, and classical stone benches sit in the shade of clipped yews. At night, soft lighting hidden among the hedgerows creates a romantic atmosphere.

To the side of the estate lies the walled kitchen garden—a productive space with red brick walls, espaliered apple trees, and raised beds full of vegetables and herbs. A Victorian-style greenhouse in iron and glass houses citrus plants and seedlings. This area also contains a tool shed and potting table, bordered by lavender hedges alive with bees.

Beyond that, a three-acre woodland walk winds beneath ancient oaks and beeches. The path is gravelled and lined with wild bluebells in spring, and there are two clearings with timber benches and a cast-iron gazebo at the farthest point—perfect for reading or picnics. A hidden speaker system plays birdsong subtly for a magical touch.

A full-sized tennis court, surfaced in clay and bordered by low stone walls, sits near the orchard. Next to it is the swimming pool complex—a heated rectangular pool with limestone paving, flanked by loungers and umbrellas. A modern pool house contains a sauna, changing room, and a small gym with floor-to-ceiling glass panels.

To the rear, the stables and garages blend seamlessly with the estate’s stonework. The stables accommodate four horses and include a tack room, hayloft, and a paddock beyond. The four-bay garage, topped with a pitched slate roof, includes an electric vehicle charging station and ample storage.

Renovating and landscaping these external areas—factoring in the pool, greenhouse, tennis court, stables, and formal gardens—would total approximately £320,000.
