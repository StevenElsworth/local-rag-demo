Occupying the north wing of the attic, the staff quarters are simple but comfortable. Two small bedrooms are painted in soft neutrals with built-in wardrobes and dormer windows. A compact kitchenette with shaker cabinets and tiled backsplash sits off the main corridor, along with a clean and modern bathroom finished in white ceramic and brushed chrome.

These rooms are more functional than decorative, but finished to a high standard for live-in caretakers or guests seeking privacy. Renovation here would include insulation, rewiring, and practical fixtures, totalling around Â£60,000.
